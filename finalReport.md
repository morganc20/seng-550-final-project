### What are some existing gaps that you seek to fill?

Within the machine learning space, existing gaps include over-reliance on single features for sentiment analysis, lack of integration/interprretability of auxiliary features within data and consistent reproducibility. 

In terms of how our work seeks to solve the problem better and add to the existing solutions, we have implemented various changes such as text preprocessing, combination of multiple features to enrich sentiment prediction, creating robust frameworks for sentiment analysis/feature classification, allowing for extensibility etc. to build on top of and surpass existing solutions. 

Our multi-algorithm solution is evaluated against rigorous performance metrics to understand its strengths, weaknesses and to ensure we are iteratively improving classification accuracy while ensuring our solution is reproducible and extendible.
