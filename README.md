This is a machine learning project that explores a variety of machine learning classification models such as Naive Bayes and Random Forest Regression to classify and predict a given data entry. The dataset we chose to train and predict our models on was the `Amazon Reviews 2023`  dataset, where the goal was to use our models to predict whether a given review was favourable or not.
